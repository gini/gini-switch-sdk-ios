  "description": "The Gini Switch SDK provides components for capturing, reviewing and analyzing photos of electricity bills in Germany.\nBy integrating this SDK into your application you can allow your users to easily take pictures of a document, review it and extract the necessary information to then proceed and change their electricity provider.\nThe SDK takes care of all interactions with our backend and provides you with customizable UI you can easily integrate within your app to take care of the whole process for you.\nEven though some of the UI's appearance is customizable, the overall user flow and UX is not. We have worked hard to find the best way to navigate our users through the process and would like partners to follow the same path.\nThe Gini Switch SDK has been designed for portrait orientation. The UI is automatically forced to portrait when being displayed.",
